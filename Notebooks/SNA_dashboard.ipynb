    "# Toxicity Network Dashboard for Eredivisie Twitter Communities\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive dashboard for exploring the structure and spread of toxicity in Twitter reply networks related to Eredivisie football clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard was developed as part of a broader tool that combines NLP-based toxicity detection with Social Network Analysis (SNA). It is intended for visual exploration of the final dataset and does not require rerunning the full computation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this dashboard offers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matchday analysis**: visualize per-match reply networks, toxic user distributions, and key community clusters.\n",
    "- **Club-level analysis**: explore reply networks, top communities, and toxicity concentrations per club.\n",
    "- **Club comparison dashboard**: compare clubs based on % toxic users, community structure, and engagement volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "All visualizations are based on the output generated in `SNA_TestV2.ipynb`, and require the preprocessed input files listed below.\n"
